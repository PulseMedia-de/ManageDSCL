ManageDSCL
==========

ManageDSCL is a very small and handy GUI for the Directory Service command line 
utility provided by Mac OS X. It's not a full supporting GUI for dscl command,
but only creates, lists and delets records with the ease of clicking a button.
It's helpful e.g. testing different RoR applications on your local machine.
